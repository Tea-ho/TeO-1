<h2 style="margin-top:45px;">2) Characteristics</h2>
The MZ generation, which is familiar with the digital environment, uses mobile first and pursues the latest trends and unique experiences that are different from others. In particular, the MZ generation is emerging as a consumer that exerts a strong influence in the distribution market based on SNS.
<p style="margin-top:45px">The MZ generation shows personal happiness rather than group, sharing (using rental or used markets) rather than ownership, and consumption that values experience rather than products, and not just purchases goods with social values or special messages.</p>
<p style="margin-top:45px;">In addition, these generations are more familiar with the "flex" culture and luxury consumption than any other generation, as many people tend to value the present rather than the future and taste rather than the price.</p>
